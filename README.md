#### Project Overview
The objective of this project is to analyze survey data from 630 data professionals to identify key trends in job roles, salary distribution, career satisfaction, and skill preferences. By examining factors such as work-life balance, programming language choices, and entry barriers, this project aims to: understand salary trends, evaluate job satisfaction, identify career entry challenges and explore skills preferences.

#### Data Sources
The primary dataset was obtained after conducting a survey on linkedin and X and stored in a csv file.

#### Tools
- Power BI
  - Power Query
  - Data Visualization

  #### Data Cleaning
  In the initial data preparation phase we performed the following task:

 -  Data loading and transformation
     - Removed unwanted columns
     - Removed duplicates
     - Removed errors
     - Changed data types
     - Split columns
     - Custom made a column
  
  #### Data Analysis
  This involved exploring the data to answer key questions such as:

    - Which is the highest paying data profession?
    - Which country has the highest number of data professionals?
    - Are data professionals satisfied with their salary and work/life balance?
    - Which skills are more preferred?
    - How difficult is it to break into the data field?

 #### Insights
  ##### 1. Salary Trends & Job Roles:
- Data Scientists have the highest average salary (88k), followed by Data Architects (64k) and Data Engineers (61k).
- Entry-level roles, such as students or those looking for jobs, have significantly lower salaries (27k).

  ##### 2.Job Satisfaction:
- Work-life balance satisfaction (5.74/10) is notably higher than salary satisfaction (4.27/10), indicating that while professionals may appreciate work flexibility, they feel underpaid.

  ##### 3. Geographical Distribution:
- The majority of professionals come from the United States, United Kingdom, India, and Canada, emphasizing these regions as data industry hubs.

 ##### 4. Career Entry Barriers:
- 42.7% of respondents found it neither easy nor difficult to enter the field, while 24.76% found it difficult.
- A significant portion (21.2%) reported the transition into data roles as easy, suggesting a mixed experience.

 ##### 5. Preferred Programming Languages
- Python dominates the field, with significantly more votes than R, JavaScript, or C/C++.
- JavaScript and Java receive little attention, reinforcing their limited relevance in data science roles.

#### Recommendations
 ##### 1. Close the Salary Gap
- Organizations should conduct salary benchmarking to ensure fair compensation, especially for roles like Data Analysts that have lower salaries despite high skill requirements.
- Equity-based incentives and skill-based promotions can help retain talent.

 ##### 2. Boost Work-Life Balance and Job Satisfaction
- Since salary satisfaction is low, employers should offer non-monetary benefits such as remote work options, career growth opportunities, and mental health support.
- Organizations should ensure reasonable workloads to enhance job satisfaction.
- Encouraging transparent salary discussions and career progression plans can improve morale.

 ##### 3. Promote Relevant Skill Development:
- Education providers should emphasize Python and R, as these are the most relevant languages for data professionals.
- Bootcamps and certifications should focus on industry use cases and real-world projects to improve job readiness.

##### 4. Improve Accessibility for Newcomers
- Companies can introduce structured internship and mentorship programs to help new professionals gain experience.
- A clear roadmap for transitioning from academia to industry can help reduce entry barriers.

 ##### 5. Encourage Geographic Workforce Expansion
- As data roles are concentrated in certain regions, companies should consider remote hiring strategies to tap into talent from emerging markets.
- Encouraging global collaboration can help diversify skill sets and perspectives in data teams.
